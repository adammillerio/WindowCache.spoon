--- === WindowCache ===
---
--- Utility for quickly retrieving windows
---
--- Download: https://github.com/adammillerio/Spoons/raw/main/Spoons/WindowCache.spoon.zip
---
--- This uses a hs.window.filter to maintain a Least Recently Used cache which
--- can be searched either by window title or application name. This is useful
--- for automations which benefit from quick access to windows.
---
--- This was implemented based entirely off of the source of
--- [hs_select_window.spoon](https://github.com/dmgerman/hs_select_window.spoon)
--- and split out to be used across other Spoons.
--- 
--- Example Usage (Using [SpoonInstall](https://zzamboni.org/post/using-spoons-in-hammerspoon/)):
--- spoon.SpoonInstall:andUse(
---   "WindowCache",
---   {
---     start = true
---   }
--- )
